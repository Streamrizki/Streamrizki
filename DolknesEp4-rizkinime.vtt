00:00.770 --> 00:01.920
Miss Yumiella...

00:02.260 --> 00:03.980
Are you the Demon Lord?

00:04.790 --> 00:05.740
Huh?

00:08.250 --> 00:09.450
The Demon Lord?

00:09.450 --> 00:11.140
Miss Yumiella? Really?

00:11.140 --> 00:13.160
I know she uses dark magic, but...

00:13.570 --> 00:17.660
<i>How does Alicia know that the 
Demon Lord is coming back?</i>

00:17.660 --> 00:20.930
Me? The Demon Lord?
What are you talking about?

00:22.900 --> 00:27.050
Ed was saying that the Demon Lord 
is coming back in two years.

00:27.430 --> 00:28.670
"Ed"?

00:29.170 --> 00:32.460
<i>She's calling the prince by a nickname 
barely a week after they first met?</i>

00:32.460 --> 00:34.940
<i>Well, her communication skills 
are level 99, if nothing else.</i>

00:36.270 --> 00:37.810
<i>But anyway...</i>

00:38.140 --> 00:39.840
<i>That stupid prince.</i>

00:39.840 --> 00:42.810
<i>Did he really blab top-secret 
information to Alicia?</i>

00:43.270 --> 00:47.060
Did Prince Edwin say that I'm the Demon Lord?

00:47.060 --> 00:51.570
He only said that the Demon Lord 
would be coming back in two years.

00:51.820 --> 00:56.000
But you're... well...

00:57.000 --> 00:58.080
The black...

00:58.280 --> 01:00.490
Black? Oh...

01:01.040 --> 01:03.810
Yes, I do have black hair,

01:03.810 --> 01:07.090
but do you have any basis for assuming 
I'm the Demon Lord because of that?

01:07.350 --> 01:12.670
And didn't we learn in magic class 
that dark magic isn't evil?

01:14.350 --> 01:15.830
Yumiella Dolkness!

01:15.830 --> 01:17.310
What have you done to Alicia?!

01:17.310 --> 01:20.240
We're here now. Everything's all right.

01:20.240 --> 01:23.850
<i>If anyone's had something 
done to her, it's me.</i>

01:24.180 --> 01:29.370
Miss Alicia was saying strange things 
about the Demon Lord returning

01:29.370 --> 01:32.490
and about me being the Demon Lord, 
so I denied it. Nothing more.

01:33.030 --> 01:36.490
<i>The Demon Lord's return 
needs to be kept secret.</i>

01:37.040 --> 01:38.880
<i>A member of the royalty should know that.</i>

01:38.880 --> 01:41.520
<i>Hurry up and tell her that stuff 
about the Demon Lord was just gossip.</i>

01:41.520 --> 01:44.130
It's true that the Demon Lord 
is going to return in two years.

01:44.560 --> 01:47.130
Only a few people know that, though.

01:47.130 --> 01:49.630
<i>This stupid prince!</i>

01:49.630 --> 01:52.630
I get it! So you're the Demon Lord!

01:52.630 --> 01:53.880
I'm not.

01:54.770 --> 01:57.850
<i>I may be the hidden boss, 
but I'm not the Demon Lord.</i>

02:23.350 --> 02:26.920
<b>Villainess Level 99</b>

02:23.570 --> 02:26.920
I May Be the Hidden Boss but I'm Not the Demon Lord

03:31.110 --> 03:33.520
<i>They're unfazed after hearing 
about the Demon Lord.</i>

03:34.440 --> 03:38.240
<i>So William and Oswald must 
have already heard about it.</i>

03:38.460 --> 03:42.370
The Demon Lord isn't coming 
back for two years, right?

03:42.370 --> 03:45.060
But I'm here right now. 
What does that make me?

03:46.930 --> 03:49.510
Y-You're gonna start doing 
evil stuff, aren't you?!

03:49.840 --> 03:51.590
I'll punish you myself!

03:51.590 --> 03:53.250
<i>This meathead...</i>

03:54.020 --> 03:55.430
Uh...

03:56.630 --> 03:58.600
You think you can beat me?

04:01.280 --> 04:04.140
Do you really think I'm 
the Demon Lord, as well?

04:04.340 --> 04:06.210
If that's what Alicia says.

04:06.210 --> 04:07.890
<i>He's an idiot, too.</i>

04:07.890 --> 04:12.650
Besides, you being the Demon Lord 
would explain that strength of yours.

04:12.870 --> 04:14.740
<i>I can't deny that.</i>

04:15.540 --> 04:17.820
Yes, I am indeed strong.

04:17.820 --> 04:20.280
As strong as the Demon Lord, perhaps.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.630
But you three are too weak.

04:24.160 --> 04:28.040
If you intend to defeat me, 
you need to get stronger.

04:28.580 --> 04:33.290
<i>I need them to get stronger so they can 
defeat the actual Demon Lord, anyway.</i>

04:34.240 --> 04:35.550
<i>No, wait.</i>

04:35.890 --> 04:40.260
<i>Maybe this is my chance to 
teach them how to level up?</i>

04:40.820 --> 04:44.200
<i>It might improve their 
opinion of me a bit, too.</i>

04:45.190 --> 04:48.530
I'd like to teach all of you 
the basics of leveling up.

04:48.530 --> 04:50.440
Huh? What are you...

04:50.680 --> 04:53.840
The fundamental way to level 
up is defeating monsters.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.560
Delve into dungeons whenever you have time,

04:56.560 --> 04:57.940
and kill as many as you can.

04:57.940 --> 04:59.700
Don't use Amulets of Protection.

04:59.700 --> 05:03.450
Wear Amulets of Growth, which 
double the experience you receive.

05:03.450 --> 05:07.510
Use a Monster-Calling Flute to defeat 
as many monsters as possible.

05:07.510 --> 05:10.080
And to maximize efficiency,

05:10.080 --> 05:13.330
you'll need to fight solo 
rather than forming a party.

05:13.850 --> 05:17.930
I recommend going for monsters 
that specialize not in defense,

05:17.930 --> 05:20.090
but in offense, because you 
spend less time fighting them.

05:20.090 --> 05:24.710
Obviously, stronger monsters are the 
most efficient for raising your level,

05:24.710 --> 05:27.220
so go as deep into the dungeon as you can.

05:27.440 --> 05:30.830
Leveling up is basically a form 
of occupational performance,

05:30.830 --> 05:35.140
so setting daily goals and doing 
your best to meet them is crucial.

05:35.140 --> 05:36.480
Especially you, Miss Alicia.

05:37.820 --> 05:41.250
Since you can use light magic,
the responsibility on you is immense.

05:41.250 --> 05:44.770
Please do your leveling 
up in a dark-type dungeon.

05:44.770 --> 05:46.490
H-Huh?

05:46.720 --> 05:48.890
<i>Yep. Nailed it.</i>

05:51.170 --> 05:54.080
<i>Looks like that was so amazing, 
they're all speechless.</i>

05:54.080 --> 05:55.500
Are...

05:55.740 --> 05:58.500
Are you trying to kill us?!

05:58.790 --> 05:59.490
Huh?

05:59.990 --> 06:02.130
Was it a little too difficult for them?

06:02.130 --> 06:03.520
Let's go.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.390
I know all of you can handle it.

06:06.360 --> 06:09.140
If you're afraid, shall I tag along with you?

06:10.100 --> 06:11.130
No need!

06:12.140 --> 06:15.020
I'll get stronger in my own way.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.240
<i>Guess I didn't get through to them.</i>

06:17.680 --> 06:22.030
<i>But everyone else here must be thrilled 
to get all that useful information...</i>

06:22.290 --> 06:24.590
Use a Monster-Calling Flute? Is she nuts?

06:24.590 --> 06:27.780
And going into a dungeon without 
an Amulet of Protection?

06:27.780 --> 06:30.510
Did you know there were dark-type dungeons?

06:30.510 --> 06:32.850
I never dreamed a place that scary existed.

06:32.850 --> 06:34.790
Maybe that's where she came from...

06:36.920 --> 06:38.900
<i>Well, this was a flop.</i>

06:39.680 --> 06:41.460
<i>But all that aside...</i>

06:42.040 --> 06:44.970
<i>Why is Alicia so wary of me?</i>

06:45.770 --> 06:48.970
<i>Could it be... she was reincarnated, like me?</i>

06:49.910 --> 06:51.340
<i>I'll have to look into it.</i>

06:54.880 --> 06:58.340
<i>If Alicia only vaguely remembers 
what happened in the game,</i>

06:58.760 --> 07:02.500
<i>I could understand her mistaking 
me for the Demon Lord, but...</i>

07:03.430 --> 07:05.400
I'll bake some cookies next time.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.610
I can't wait.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.820
Doing okay in your classes?

07:10.820 --> 07:12.610
Yeah, I think so.

07:15.090 --> 07:17.580
Wow, you live near the ocean, huh?

07:17.580 --> 07:18.130
Yep.

07:19.570 --> 07:22.130
<i>I tried observing Alicia for a day,</i>

07:22.940 --> 07:25.130
<i>but she's just... a nice girl.</i>

07:25.230 --> 07:33.140
Alicia

07:25.230 --> 07:33.140
(I'm an ordinary citizen, after all.)

07:25.590 --> 07:28.910
<i>In the game, she's the 
cheerful, innocent type.</i>

07:28.910 --> 07:33.140
<i>She enrolls in the academy so she 
can use her magic to help others.</i>

07:33.140 --> 07:37.640
Alicia

07:33.140 --> 07:37.640
(I'll never fit in with all of them...)

07:33.750 --> 07:36.100
<i>At first, she doesn't 
understand noble customs,</i>

07:36.100 --> 07:37.640
<i>so she doesn't fit in.</i>

07:37.640 --> 07:43.170
Edwin

07:37.640 --> 07:43.170
Alicia, you know we're on your side.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.020
<i>Then the conquerable characters help her out,</i>

07:41.020 --> 07:42.760
<i>and she opens up to them.</i>

07:45.780 --> 07:47.620
Good kitty.

07:51.050 --> 07:53.160
<i>In this world, too...</i>

07:53.160 --> 07:54.410
Meow, meow.

07:54.410 --> 07:58.420
<i>She's kind to everyone, 
and she's very cheerful.</i>

07:58.900 --> 08:02.420
<i>It's only her reactions 
to me that are strange.</i>

08:03.330 --> 08:07.170
<i>Also, I feel like I don't see her 
with other girls very often...</i>

08:07.540 --> 08:10.800
<i>But I guess having those three 
guys with her all the time</i>

08:10.800 --> 08:12.550
<i>makes it hard to approach her.</i>

08:13.000 --> 08:14.560
Bye, kitty.

08:17.560 --> 08:18.720
<i>Gotta follow her...</i>

08:21.920 --> 08:26.310
<i>But first, there's something I need to do.</i>

08:27.090 --> 08:28.180
<i>Kitty!</i>

08:33.010 --> 08:33.830
Meow, meow.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.930
<i>I figured that would happen.</i>

08:43.930 --> 08:48.230
<i>Ever since I reincarnated as Yumiella, 
animals seem terrified of me.</i>

08:50.840 --> 08:55.100
<i>He's one of my classmates. 
I think his name is...</i>

08:56.130 --> 08:57.730
<i>No, more importantly...</i>

08:58.060 --> 08:59.140
Were you watching?

08:59.140 --> 09:01.140
No, I didn't see anything.

09:01.650 --> 09:03.080
<i>He definitely saw.</i>

09:04.230 --> 09:06.150
It's not that it ran away from me.

09:06.660 --> 09:10.340
I could've caught that cat, but
it would have taken the use of force.

09:10.340 --> 09:14.660
So I suppose it would be more 
correct to say I let it get away.

09:18.660 --> 09:21.160
Pardon me. I have things to do.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.870
<i>Where did she go?</i>

09:29.730 --> 09:30.800
<i>There!</i>

09:33.760 --> 09:37.790
Um, I've never heard this incantation before.

09:37.790 --> 09:41.680
Oh, right, you might not 
be familiar with that one.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.440
It's something that nobles in Valschein know.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.020
I see!

09:46.530 --> 09:49.190
<i>She's getting Edwin to help her study.</i>

09:49.190 --> 09:51.080
<i>It's like an otome game.</i>

09:51.080 --> 09:53.530
<i>I mean, it is an otome game, but...</i>

09:55.080 --> 09:59.320
<i>Does this mean Alicia has 
started on Edwin's route?</i>

09:59.320 --> 10:00.540
By the way, Alicia...

10:00.810 --> 10:04.110
Why did you think Yumiella 
Dolkness was the Demon Lord?

10:04.790 --> 10:08.920
She isn't the Demon Lord. 
My father said as much.

10:10.030 --> 10:11.030
But...

10:11.670 --> 10:14.600
It's true that she uses dark magic,

10:14.600 --> 10:18.250
has black hair, and is level 99.

10:18.250 --> 10:22.110
But it's not right to assume she's 
the Demon Lord just because of that.

10:25.390 --> 10:27.440
What... is that?

10:28.200 --> 10:29.570
It's Miss Yumiella.

10:31.070 --> 10:34.470
This is how Miss Yumiella looks to me.

10:34.470 --> 10:35.820
Frightening.

10:36.640 --> 10:41.330
It may have something to 
do with my light magic.

10:41.330 --> 10:43.370
Ah...

10:44.280 --> 10:47.330
<i>What does that mean?
The compatibility of attributes?</i>

10:47.330 --> 10:51.040
Yumiella Dolkness is indeed
abnormally strong.

10:51.040 --> 10:54.340
It can't be such an easy 
thing to reach level 99.

10:54.820 --> 10:59.050
Even if she's not the Demon Lord,
I won't let my guard down around her.

11:00.720 --> 11:05.200
Although it seems my father wants her to 
join the force that battles the Demon Lord.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.650
He does?

11:06.650 --> 11:10.360
I suppose it only makes sense, 
given her strength, but...

11:11.410 --> 11:15.360
With your light magic, you're also 
a valuable asset to the battle.

11:15.570 --> 11:20.490
In other words, we'll all work together 
to face the Demon Lord one day.

11:22.050 --> 11:23.190
Alicia...

11:23.500 --> 11:27.170
I'm sorry for getting you involved in such a 
dangerous thing as fighting the Demon Lord.

11:28.420 --> 11:32.210
You didn't! If the world is 
in danger, it's my business!

11:32.690 --> 11:34.920
If I can be of use with my magic,

11:34.920 --> 11:37.130
I want to do whatever I can.

11:37.980 --> 11:40.590
So let's do our best together, Ed!

11:41.390 --> 11:44.040
Yeah. Let's defeat the Demon Lord together.

11:42.870 --> 11:46.930
<i>In any case, it doesn't seem 
like Alicia was reincarnated.</i>

11:44.040 --> 11:44.730
Right!

11:51.270 --> 11:54.780
Principal, I heard you wanted to see me.

11:54.780 --> 11:55.490
Come in.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.240
<i>Someone else's voice?</i>

11:59.040 --> 12:00.950
Pleased to meet you, Miss Yumiella.

12:01.230 --> 12:04.900
I'm Ronald. I've been appointed 
as the new principal.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.610
I am Yumiella Dolkness.

12:08.610 --> 12:11.330
Um, where is the former principal?

12:11.750 --> 12:13.180
He resigned.

12:13.180 --> 12:15.090
You needn't worry about it.

12:15.330 --> 12:17.710
<i>His smile looks so fake.</i>

12:17.710 --> 12:21.600
<i>Like the very model of a smile 
meant to put one at ease.</i>

12:22.260 --> 12:25.390
I've come to the academy 
on the king's orders.

12:25.390 --> 12:29.490
I'm also aware of the Demon Lord's 
impending return, so you can relax.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.250
Please, sit.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.060
Yes, sir.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.000
Here you go.

12:34.810 --> 12:36.230
Thank you.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.830
<i>He's been informed about 
the Demon Lord's return.</i>

12:38.830 --> 12:42.490
<i>That must mean the king trusts him.</i>

12:42.780 --> 12:45.060
What a troublemaker Prince Edwin is.

12:45.570 --> 12:49.500
To think he spoke of a state 
secret in public like that.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.490
I'm sure you had it rough, too.

12:51.490 --> 12:55.770
<i>Eh. I've been an object of curiosity 
ever since the entrance ceremony.</i>

12:56.450 --> 13:00.040
His Highness wasn't always 
the type to behave so rashly,

13:00.040 --> 13:02.200
but recently, he's been... unstable.

13:02.730 --> 13:06.770
Even his two supporters have 
been acting the same way.

13:07.030 --> 13:09.590
Did something happen to the three of them?

13:10.780 --> 13:12.150
You're really asking that?

13:12.150 --> 13:13.900
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

13:14.150 --> 13:17.620
All three of them had been exceptionally 
brilliant since childhood,

13:17.620 --> 13:22.490
but then someone suddenly showed 
up and shattered their pride.

13:23.030 --> 13:25.410
I can't blame them for being shaken by that.

13:25.870 --> 13:28.250
As for the matter of the Demon Lord's return,

13:28.250 --> 13:30.910
we will be denying it in an 
official address from the kingdom.

13:31.220 --> 13:35.600
But it's practically impossible to 
extinguish a rumor once it's spread.

13:36.210 --> 13:37.170
Of course,

13:37.460 --> 13:41.210
the king understands that there's 
no way you can be the Demon Lord,

13:41.210 --> 13:42.410
so you can relax.

13:43.700 --> 13:48.190
How much information does the royal 
family have about the Demon Lord?

13:48.190 --> 13:50.630
I don't know that myself.

13:51.940 --> 13:55.690
<i>It's no use. I can't tell what he's thinking.</i>

13:56.020 --> 13:58.320
<i>I can't say why, but this guy just irks me.</i>

13:58.320 --> 14:02.440
Anyway, I didn't just want to say 
hello to you. I have a favor to ask.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.950
A favor? Of me?

14:05.180 --> 14:08.210
Yes. When our field lessons 
begin in the near future,

14:08.210 --> 14:10.700
I want you on the administrative side.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.160
Field lessons?

14:13.390 --> 14:17.710
<b>The Hidden Boss Attends Field Lessons</b>

14:17.710 --> 14:18.500
Coming your way!

14:18.500 --> 14:19.160
I got 'em!

14:19.160 --> 14:19.980
Surround it!

14:19.980 --> 14:20.980
No! Stay away!

14:29.970 --> 14:34.270
<i>Here, a "field lesson" 
basically means leveling up.</i>

14:34.270 --> 14:36.400
<i>The academy sends students to hunt monsters,</i>

14:36.610 --> 14:38.730
<i>while keeping their safety in mind.</i>

14:39.640 --> 14:44.110
<i>It's true that there's no need for me 
to participate, since I'm level 99.</i>

14:44.430 --> 14:47.420
<i>And if I accidentally wiped 
out all the monsters,</i>

14:47.420 --> 14:49.740
<i>I'd ruin it for all the other students.</i>

14:49.740 --> 14:53.410
<i>Field lessons are divided up between 
central nobles and regional nobles.</i>

14:54.200 --> 14:56.920
You'll be in charge of the regional nobles.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.720
That's a very broad method 
of dividing them up.

14:59.720 --> 15:02.210
Regional nobles fight 
monsters in their domains

15:02.210 --> 15:05.990
more often than city-dwelling central nobles.

15:05.990 --> 15:09.220
That inevitably creates a clear difference 
in their motivation to level up.

15:09.590 --> 15:12.180
Separating them is more efficient.

15:12.180 --> 15:17.560
Will Prince Edwin and his companions attend 
the field lesson with the central nobles?

15:17.820 --> 15:21.780
I've arranged a supplementary lesson 
for special training for them.

15:21.780 --> 15:23.400
<i>Special training?!</i>

15:24.080 --> 15:26.530
<i>I'm dying to know how they get to level up!</i>

15:26.750 --> 15:32.290
The goal is to get them to level 
40 by the time they graduate.

15:33.570 --> 15:37.040
I'd like it if they could 
get closer to level 60.

15:37.550 --> 15:40.000
Captain Adolf is level 60.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.990
They can't get that far in two years.

15:42.870 --> 15:45.710
<i>I think it's plenty possible, myself...</i>

15:45.710 --> 15:47.930
Okay, time for a break.

15:48.520 --> 15:51.210
Those of you who are out of magic or injured,

15:51.210 --> 15:53.920
don't forget to replenish with potions!

15:52.820 --> 15:55.290
<i>What a peaceful field lesson this is.</i>

15:55.290 --> 15:56.940
<i>There are too few.</i>

15:55.650 --> 15:57.170
Here's a potion.

15:56.940 --> 16:00.630
<i>And they're throwing way too much 
power at some low-level monsters.</i>

15:57.170 --> 15:58.690
Oh, thanks.

15:58.970 --> 16:00.630
How many did you kill?

16:00.630 --> 16:02.190
Two, I think.

16:00.630 --> 16:02.190
<i>It's obviously overkill.</i>

16:02.190 --> 16:03.740
I couldn't even kill one.

16:02.610 --> 16:05.170
<i>And with the teachers' protection, too.</i>

16:03.270 --> 16:05.380
I need to work on my bow skills.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.230
Real monsters do have a lot more impact.

16:06.230 --> 16:11.220
<i>I know they can't afford to endanger 
the son of royalty, but this...</i>

16:11.220 --> 16:12.700
Too inefficient.

16:15.410 --> 16:16.810
<i>The guy who saw me with the cat...</i>

16:17.330 --> 16:19.010
Um...

16:19.010 --> 16:20.850
I'm Patrick Ashbatten.

16:20.850 --> 16:24.010
You also think this is inefficient?

16:24.010 --> 16:27.220
I think they could handle a 
larger number of monsters.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.690
Yeah.

16:28.690 --> 16:31.570
If they split into a vanguard and 
rear guard and work together,

16:31.570 --> 16:33.180
it's more than possible.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.450
<i>I haven't spoken with a 
classmate like this in ages.</i>

16:36.450 --> 16:40.230
Do they split into vanguard and rear guard 
to level up in the Ashbattens' domain?

16:40.510 --> 16:43.520
Yeah. The vanguard holds 
the monsters in place,

16:43.520 --> 16:46.480
and the rear guard attacks 
them. That's basic.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.240
Doesn't that result in

16:48.240 --> 16:51.070
differing amounts of experience 
for the vanguard and rear guard?

16:51.070 --> 16:52.400
We reverse it, too.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.300
The rear guard uses magic to 
stop the monsters' movements,

16:55.300 --> 16:57.070
while the vanguard attacks.

16:57.390 --> 16:59.250
It does bring down the balance, though.

16:59.470 --> 17:02.830
<i>I guess working as one group 
does reduce efficiency.</i>

17:02.830 --> 17:03.750
<i>Meaning...</i>

17:04.210 --> 17:07.350
<i>My idea of how to level up wasn't wrong!</i>

17:07.760 --> 17:11.300
Could we use that method here, right now?

17:11.300 --> 17:13.640
I think we have enough people,

17:14.180 --> 17:16.890
but with so few monsters, I 
don't think it would matter.

17:17.460 --> 17:19.810
I have something useful.

17:20.070 --> 17:21.520
A Monster-Calling Flute?!

17:21.960 --> 17:22.940
Wait, don't!

17:25.080 --> 17:25.940
What?

17:25.940 --> 17:27.820
Miss Yumiella! What are you—

17:32.070 --> 17:33.100
Wh-What?

17:33.100 --> 17:33.630
What is that?

17:33.630 --> 17:35.410
Everyone with a shield 
and spear to the front!

17:35.410 --> 17:36.480
G-Got it!

17:36.480 --> 17:37.200
Hurry!

17:39.490 --> 17:41.990
Vanguard, focus on stopping the monsters!

17:41.990 --> 17:44.210
Rear guard, use ranged magic attacks!

17:44.780 --> 17:47.950
If you run out of magic, attack 
whatever's left with weapons!

17:47.950 --> 17:48.710
Got it!

17:48.710 --> 17:51.630
If you get hurt, fall back 
and heal with a potion!

17:51.630 --> 17:52.220
Right!

17:59.800 --> 18:00.560
Attack!

18:07.860 --> 18:09.190
Follow up the attack!

18:22.280 --> 18:23.060
You all right?!

18:23.060 --> 18:23.620
Yeah...

18:23.830 --> 18:25.650
Vanguard, regroup right away!

18:25.650 --> 18:26.290
Right!

18:26.720 --> 18:28.670
Don't panic! Finish them all!

18:37.500 --> 18:38.810
Wow...

18:45.410 --> 18:48.440
Yumiella! How could you 
do that without warning?!

18:49.450 --> 18:51.460
<i>Why is he so angry?</i>

18:52.130 --> 18:53.440
<i>Oh, I know.</i>

18:54.120 --> 18:56.000
<i>Because the rear guard exhausted themselves</i>

18:56.000 --> 18:58.950
<i>to the point that the 
vanguard couldn't level up.</i>

18:59.380 --> 19:01.720
There's no need to worry.

19:02.890 --> 19:05.200
I know some of them have 
exhausted their magic,

19:05.200 --> 19:07.400
so I'll hold the monsters in place next time.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.960
Huh? Next time?

19:09.590 --> 19:10.750
No!

19:12.290 --> 19:13.690
Not again!

19:13.690 --> 19:15.500
We're really gonna die this time!

19:15.500 --> 19:17.680
I'll stop the monsters' movements.

19:18.190 --> 19:20.050
Those of you in the vanguard

19:20.050 --> 19:22.590
can take your time killing them.

19:25.870 --> 19:27.100
Dark Bind.

19:34.360 --> 19:36.750
Go ahead and attack them.

19:36.750 --> 19:38.990
Um, was that...

19:39.430 --> 19:41.120
It was my magic.

19:41.120 --> 19:45.200
It's called Dark Bind. It renders 
the target unable to move.

19:45.520 --> 19:47.370
And we won't get attacked?

19:47.710 --> 19:51.630
You'll be fine. The monsters 
are firmly restrained.

19:51.630 --> 19:54.100
Uh, I don't mean by the monsters...

19:59.210 --> 20:01.640
There's no problem. This method is safe.

20:01.990 --> 20:04.050
Seems like it's okay... maybe?

20:04.050 --> 20:05.660
Well, in that case...

20:05.660 --> 20:06.140
Yeah...

20:06.400 --> 20:09.270
<i>Was he talking about my magic?</i>

20:09.270 --> 20:11.150
<i>Is it that scary?</i>

20:12.320 --> 20:15.400
Your leadership was brilliant.

20:15.780 --> 20:18.280
I am the son of a margrave, after all.

20:18.680 --> 20:21.130
I was involved in some 
combat before I enrolled...

20:24.000 --> 20:25.660
I guess you meant no harm.

20:25.660 --> 20:27.150
What are you talking about?

20:27.150 --> 20:28.070
Nothing.

20:37.060 --> 20:38.340
I'll heal you.

20:38.340 --> 20:39.110
Huh?

20:41.200 --> 20:44.670
Dark magic also has healing 
and recovery spells.

20:44.990 --> 20:47.730
There's one downside, however.

20:48.280 --> 20:49.540
It's super grotesque.

20:50.180 --> 20:52.180
Yikes...

20:55.780 --> 20:59.370
You should be all right now. 
Do you feel any pain?

21:01.510 --> 21:04.740
No. I'm fine. Thanks.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.390
<i>Oh, good.</i>

21:06.390 --> 21:10.280
<i>I didn't know what I'd do if it had side 
effects on people of other attributes.</i>

21:11.120 --> 21:13.590
Why did you jump in front of me?

21:13.590 --> 21:15.670
Sorry. I thought you were in danger.

21:16.340 --> 21:19.420
<i>In danger? At level 99?</i>

21:20.340 --> 21:23.050
You need to take better care of yourself.

21:23.050 --> 21:25.330
It'll be too late once something happens.

21:26.130 --> 21:31.390
<i>Did he really just try to protect 
me because he was worried about me?</i>

21:34.100 --> 21:37.080
Th-Thank you.

21:37.080 --> 21:41.190
<i>This has never happened before. 
I feel kind of embarrassed.</i>

21:41.190 --> 21:42.200
Yumiella...

21:42.760 --> 21:47.060
Next time you're going to use the 
Monster-Calling Flute, say so first.

21:47.060 --> 21:48.470
All right.

21:48.470 --> 21:50.610
In that case, I'm going to use it again now.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.640
Huh? Wait, Yumiella!

21:53.680 --> 21:54.890
You're kidding!

21:54.890 --> 21:56.100
No more!

21:56.100 --> 21:57.740
Miss Yumiella!

21:57.740 --> 21:59.020
Dark Bind.

22:02.500 --> 22:03.720
Dark Bind.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.450
Again?!

22:06.600 --> 22:09.970
Stop it!
