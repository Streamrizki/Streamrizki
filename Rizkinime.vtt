00:13.340 --> 00:16.010
Wow! Look at the snow!

00:19.200 --> 00:22.200
<b>Dad</b>

00:19.200 --> 00:22.200
<b>Sorry I can't pick you up.
I'll be done with work soon.
Can you go ahead to the house?</b>

00:22.670 --> 00:24.220
<i>All right, Dad.</i>

00:27.620 --> 00:29.750
<i>I guess I got in a little early.</i>

00:30.400 --> 00:31.420
<i>So what now?</i>

00:36.550 --> 00:37.410
Um...

00:43.270 --> 00:45.090
You sure you're good here?

00:45.450 --> 00:48.000
Yes. It should be close.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.410
Wow, it's so spacious.

01:02.010 --> 01:05.620
<i>There's no one here and there 
aren't any cars. It's so quiet.</i>

01:06.080 --> 01:09.020
<i>It's nothing like Tokyo.</i>

01:09.750 --> 01:12.340
<i>And this fresh air...</i>

01:12.670 --> 01:15.040
<i>is freezing! It's freezing my lungs!</i>

01:15.040 --> 01:18.690
<i>And I'm just realizing how cold it is!</i>

01:18.690 --> 01:20.470
<i>How can it be </i>this<i> cold?</i>

01:20.810 --> 01:23.360
<i>Winter in Hokkaido is insane!</i>

01:27.230 --> 01:29.690
<i>Th-This sucks!</i>

01:35.500 --> 01:40.850
Maybe it was a mistake to move to 
Hokkaido at this time of year, Dad.

01:47.740 --> 01:51.910
Okay, this is bad. 
My battery's gonna die on me.

02:06.480 --> 02:10.300
<i>A gyaru? A Hokkaido gyaru?</i>

02:11.540 --> 02:15.920
<b>Episode 1:
Hokkaido Gals Are Super Adorable!</b>

02:11.540 --> 02:15.920
<b>Episode 1:
Hokkaido Gals Are Super Adorable!</b>

02:14.420 --> 02:16.240
<i>A... a gyaru?</i>

02:16.980 --> 02:19.920
<i>Bare-legged when it's this cold?</i>

02:19.920 --> 02:22.290
<i>She doesn't even have a heavy jacket on.</i>

02:23.240 --> 02:27.250
<i>And here I'm fully armored and 
I'm still freezing to death.</i>

02:29.080 --> 02:29.620
Hmm?

02:29.620 --> 02:30.410
Uh...

02:30.410 --> 02:31.190
What?

02:31.190 --> 02:33.210
Huh? Uh, yeah...

02:33.560 --> 02:34.380
Hmm?

02:35.010 --> 02:41.430
Oh, right! Um, I'm trying to go somewhere. 
Can you tell me the way?

02:48.250 --> 02:54.000
<i>Wow. Her nose is rosy and looks kind of cute.</i>

02:54.000 --> 02:55.730
It's waaay that way.

02:55.730 --> 02:59.440
Huh? Is it really? Thank you very much.

03:02.620 --> 03:05.510
Phew. That was close.

03:05.510 --> 03:07.360
She nearly had me mesmerized.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.100
Hey! Hold on!

03:09.100 --> 03:10.790
Huh? Yes?

03:10.790 --> 03:12.080
You planning to walk?

03:12.080 --> 03:14.250
Huh? Well, yes.

03:14.250 --> 03:16.350
It'll take like three hours.

03:16.350 --> 03:17.800
And it's snowing.

03:17.800 --> 03:18.640
Huh?

03:18.640 --> 03:23.840
But isn't this the city? Is it really 
that far to the next town over?

03:23.840 --> 03:27.140
Yeah. I mean, Kitami is way huge.

03:28.450 --> 03:31.140
<b>City of Kitami</b>

03:28.830 --> 03:31.140
Of all cities in the prefecture,
the City of Kitami
is #1 in land area!!

03:29.910 --> 03:31.140
<b>Hokkaido
Way Huge Tho</b>

03:31.140 --> 03:34.790
I totally picked the wrong 
place to get out of the taxi!

03:35.130 --> 03:37.960
I thought it would be a 
casual walk to the next town!

03:37.960 --> 03:40.190
What the hell was I thinking?

03:40.910 --> 03:44.260
Oh, right! I just need to get another taxi!

03:44.260 --> 03:46.210
Taxis don't come through here.

03:52.610 --> 03:55.190
If I call one, will it come soon?

03:55.190 --> 03:57.460
If you're lucky, maybe 30 minutes.

03:59.060 --> 04:01.930
<i>I... I'm totally screwed.</i>

04:01.930 --> 04:03.350
Or, like,

04:04.260 --> 04:07.350
wanna wait with me? For the bus?

04:07.350 --> 04:11.770
Bus Stop

04:07.350 --> 04:11.770
<b>...no Apartments</b>

04:08.030 --> 04:08.980
The bus?

04:08.980 --> 04:11.770
Yeah. It'll take you to that town

04:11.770 --> 04:13.520
and it's coming in five minutes.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.400
Will it really? I'll wait, I'll wait!

04:16.680 --> 04:21.940
Wow, what a relief. Without your help, 
I really might have died out here.

04:21.940 --> 04:23.590
Thank you so much!

04:23.590 --> 04:26.320
It's no biggie.

04:26.740 --> 04:30.420
So, where are you from? Not Hokkaido, right?

04:30.420 --> 04:33.500
Right. I moved here from Tokyo today.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.120
T-Tokyo?

04:35.430 --> 04:37.100
Um... uh-huh.

04:37.100 --> 04:38.800
<i>What's wrong with her all of a sudden?</i>

04:38.800 --> 04:44.000
Huh... huh. But why move from 
Tokyo way out to the sticks here?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.720
For family reasons.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.100
Oh, okay.

04:47.600 --> 04:51.810
But compared to Tokyo, isn't this, 
like, totally mid? Kitami, I mean.

04:51.810 --> 04:53.280
Uh... yeah?

04:54.190 --> 04:55.970
What a weird accent.

04:57.990 --> 05:01.320
I bet you think we're 
all super lame out here.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.570
No, I don't think that.

05:04.950 --> 05:06.660
Quite the opposite.

05:06.880 --> 05:07.820
Huh?

05:07.820 --> 05:09.520
Or rather, I find it relaxing here.

05:11.460 --> 05:16.610
<i>I used to get bullied for being "lame." 
I don't know what it's like to be popular.</i>

05:16.610 --> 05:20.590
<i>Even if you're from Tokyo, lame is lame.</i>

05:20.900 --> 05:25.470
But nobody here knows how lame 
I am, so it's kind of a relief.

05:29.260 --> 05:31.420
You seem like an all right guy.

05:33.030 --> 05:34.870
So how old are you?

05:34.870 --> 05:36.080
I'm sixteen.

05:36.810 --> 05:39.030
Huh? Same as me!

05:39.030 --> 05:40.510
What school are you going to?

05:40.510 --> 05:42.150
Ho-Hokuryo High School!

05:42.150 --> 05:44.130
Huh? No way!

05:44.130 --> 05:45.240
<i>Too close!</i>

05:44.460 --> 05:46.320
I go to Hokuryo, too!

05:47.530 --> 05:51.450
I can't believe it. This is so hilarious.

05:51.450 --> 05:53.950
<i>How'd she sneak up on me like that?</i>

05:53.950 --> 05:55.930
<i>Too fast! Way too fast!</i>

05:55.930 --> 05:58.500
Uh, what about your arm?

05:58.500 --> 05:59.200
Hmm?

05:59.610 --> 06:02.460
Well, it's cold. Should I stop?

06:02.460 --> 06:03.630
No, no, no, no, no, no!

06:03.630 --> 06:07.050
It's-It's fine with me, it's just...

06:07.050 --> 06:10.590
<i>I've made contact with something squishy!</i>

06:10.590 --> 06:14.660
Hey, do you always sound so uptight? 
Let's be more casual.

06:14.660 --> 06:17.210
Uh, well... okay.

06:18.070 --> 06:21.510
<i>It's this cold and she isn't wearing gloves?</i>

06:22.940 --> 06:24.010
You okay?

06:24.320 --> 06:28.610
Hmm... oh, geez. By dose is rudding.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.270
<i>What is happening?</i>

06:34.460 --> 06:36.200
Uh, here. A tissue.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.770
Oh, thanks.

06:39.510 --> 06:41.500
<i>This is too much!</i>

06:42.270 --> 06:47.010
<i>Yeah. Because I never even talked 
to a girl like this in Tokyo.</i>

06:47.010 --> 06:49.400
<i>I wonder if all Hokkaido girls are like this.</i>

06:49.400 --> 06:50.160
Hey, hey!

06:50.160 --> 06:50.660
<i>Maybe,</i>

06:50.660 --> 06:51.510
Ahoy!

06:51.210 --> 06:53.150
<i>here in Hokkaido, I can get...</i>

06:53.150 --> 06:53.850
Take that!

06:54.930 --> 06:55.940
Cold, cold! Too cold!

06:56.580 --> 06:58.170
What, what? What did you do?!

06:59.180 --> 07:02.610
Chilly, right? That's what 
you get for ignoring me.

07:03.130 --> 07:04.480
Oh, it's just snow.

07:05.710 --> 07:08.100
Yeah, great reaction though, dude!

07:21.000 --> 07:22.330
So pretty...

07:22.330 --> 07:23.250
Huh?!

07:23.250 --> 07:25.750
Ah! Sorry, I was just—

07:26.550 --> 07:29.720
Hey! Would you cut the crap?

07:30.910 --> 07:32.460
Totally not cool.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.820
Okay, I'm going.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.700
Uh, um...

07:46.440 --> 07:48.530
What's your name?

07:54.870 --> 07:56.030
Fuyuki Minami.

07:58.620 --> 08:01.250
'Kay, see you at school.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.620
Fuyuki Minami, huh?

08:22.460 --> 08:24.970
I'm so glad I came to Hokkaido!

08:26.810 --> 08:29.190
<b>Dad</b>

08:26.810 --> 08:29.190
<b>Are you there yet?</b>

08:30.570 --> 08:31.490
Uh.

08:31.490 --> 08:35.790
Oh, crap! I forgot to get on the bus!

08:39.280 --> 08:40.910
<b></b>Touch Card Here

08:39.280 --> 08:41.040
<b>Tickets</b>

08:39.660 --> 08:41.450
<b><b></b>Card Balance</b>

08:46.830 --> 08:49.100
It'd be cool if he's in my class.

08:55.520 --> 08:57.890
I'll introduce you to 
our new transfer student.

08:57.890 --> 09:00.920
Hello, my name is Shiki Tsubasa.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.460
I moved here from Tokyo yesterday.

09:04.570 --> 09:05.940
I'm really glad to meet you all.

09:07.900 --> 09:11.370
Great, Shiki. Why don't you sit 
in the back on the hall side.

09:11.770 --> 09:13.110
All right.

09:16.530 --> 09:18.530
Okay, time for attendance.

09:19.770 --> 09:23.290
<i>I guess that girl is in 
a different class, then.</i>

09:24.590 --> 09:27.270
<i>Oh, well. It's not a big deal.</i>

09:29.450 --> 09:34.170
<i>I mean, I've always liked dark-haired, 
neat, serious girls anyway.</i>

09:34.440 --> 09:37.470
<i>I never knew any girls like her 
before, so she surprised me.</i>

09:37.470 --> 09:40.530
That's the only reason I thought 
Hokkaido gals are awesome.

09:43.210 --> 09:45.180
Brrr! It's so cold.

09:45.180 --> 09:46.020
Huh?

09:47.310 --> 09:50.810
Huh? The guy from yesterday! 
This is hilarious!

09:49.720 --> 09:51.940
Ah! Um...

09:50.810 --> 09:54.080
Hey, Fuyuki! You're late again!

09:52.580 --> 09:55.420
And in the seat next to me? Too perfect!

09:56.290 --> 09:57.780
So we <i>are</i> in the same class.

09:57.780 --> 10:01.960
<i>Wait, wait! No way! Does this 
cliché stuff happen in real life?</i>

10:06.250 --> 10:09.760
So you're Shiki Tsubasa? What a pretty name.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.540
D-Do you think so?

10:11.540 --> 10:14.380
Yeah. Anyway, nice to meet you,

10:14.380 --> 10:14.960
Huh?

10:15.200 --> 10:16.630
Tsubasa.

10:17.970 --> 10:23.120
<i>My first name? So wack! This is so wack! 
She's whacking down my boundaries!</i>

10:23.120 --> 10:26.680
<i>Nobody except my family and my buddies 
have ever called me by my first name!</i>

10:28.690 --> 10:31.520
N-Nice to meet you, too, Fuyuki-san.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.900
Uh, so the apex of the triangle...

10:37.900 --> 10:41.280
<i>It's cold! It's super cold in here!</i>

10:41.280 --> 10:44.090
<i>What, is this room a freezer?</i>

10:44.090 --> 10:46.450
<i>How can people take classes like this?</i>

10:46.450 --> 10:50.580
<i>But wait, it looks like everyone's 
got jackets and blankets on.</i>

10:50.580 --> 10:53.160
<i>I didn't do enough research!</i>

10:53.160 --> 10:55.530
<i>I'm gonna catch a cold.</i>

10:55.530 --> 10:57.630
<i>If I at least had a coat...</i>

11:05.080 --> 11:06.860
Are you sure?

11:06.860 --> 11:10.850
Yeah. I get cold easy so I use two at once.

11:10.850 --> 11:12.310
Huh? But then...

11:12.570 --> 11:16.290
It's fine, it's fine. I'm toasty 
enough with one right now.

11:16.290 --> 11:18.270
I'll let you borrow that one for today.

11:23.050 --> 11:26.370
<i>Ahh, it's so warm!</i>

11:27.120 --> 11:32.010
<i>It's still warm from Fuyuki-san's body. 
It even smells nice.</i>

11:32.340 --> 11:35.380
<i>It almost feels like Fuyuki-san's 
own warm embrace...</i>

11:37.420 --> 11:41.430
<i>Oh, crap! Any more of this and my 
hormones are gonna go berserk!</i>

11:47.350 --> 11:49.100
See ya, Fuyumina.

11:49.100 --> 11:49.980
Yeah.

11:49.980 --> 11:51.130
Fuyuki-san.

11:51.810 --> 11:54.530
Thank you for the blanket. It really helped.

11:59.110 --> 12:00.620
You're smelling it?!

12:00.620 --> 12:02.280
Sure, I'm smellin' it.

12:02.520 --> 12:05.830
Sorry. If it stinks, I'll wash it for you.

12:05.830 --> 12:08.450
No, it isn't bad.

12:08.690 --> 12:12.440
I mean, this smell... it smells 
like you and me smooshed together.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.460
Smooshed?!

12:13.930 --> 12:17.300
<i>Th-This woman... Did she say that on purpose?</i>

12:17.300 --> 12:19.630
Oh, that's right. Hey, Tsubasa.

12:19.630 --> 12:23.400
Maybe there is a way you can 
thank me for the blanket.

12:27.180 --> 12:31.900
You're a lifesaver! I didn't have 
anyone else to walk me home today.

12:31.900 --> 12:34.810
B-But, Fuyuki-san... your arm!

12:34.810 --> 12:36.770
Yeah, we're tight, aren't we?

12:36.770 --> 12:40.090
<i>Hold on. I only met you yesterday!</i>

12:40.430 --> 12:43.360
So, Fuyuki-san, where do you live?

12:43.360 --> 12:47.780
Hmm? Oh, I take the locomotive home, 
so just get me to the station.

12:47.780 --> 12:48.800
Locomotive?

12:49.240 --> 12:51.250
You mean the train?

12:51.250 --> 12:54.250
Yeah, yeah. I call it the locomotive.

12:55.530 --> 12:58.330
So, Tsubasa, do you have a girlfriend?

12:59.840 --> 13:00.840
Of course not!

13:00.840 --> 13:04.300
Hah! You're totally denying it! Hilarious!

13:04.700 --> 13:07.040
Where do you go for dates in Tokyo?

13:07.040 --> 13:11.780
Well, Harajuku, I guess. Or maybe Shin-Okubo.

13:12.390 --> 13:13.890
<i>Even though I've never been on a date before.</i>

13:13.890 --> 13:17.240
Huh? You don't go to Shibuya? 
Like to Marukyu?

13:17.240 --> 13:19.750
I think a lot of people 
shop for clothes there,

13:19.750 --> 13:23.810
but people say it's better to go somewhere 
you can get snacks and walk around.

13:23.810 --> 13:26.670
<i>And I've still never gone. 
Just read about it online.</i>

13:26.670 --> 13:30.560
That's so cool. Tokyo has so 
many more places to hang out.

13:30.560 --> 13:34.120
Really? So where do you 
go to hang out in Kitami?

13:34.390 --> 13:38.080
Home. Winter is too cold 
so we don't go outside.

13:38.330 --> 13:41.090
We visit each other at home.

13:42.230 --> 13:43.300
Huh...

13:44.080 --> 13:47.320
<i>Seriously? I'm already going to her house?</i>

13:49.280 --> 13:51.310
<i>Wait, what the hell am I thinking?</i>

13:51.310 --> 13:53.310
Ah, here is good.

13:53.310 --> 13:53.910
Huh?

13:54.810 --> 13:57.120
O-Oh, that's right.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.600
Thank you, Tsubasa.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.700
Uh, sure. You're welcome.

14:02.730 --> 14:04.010
I guess I'll see you later.

14:04.880 --> 14:05.600
Tsubasa!

14:05.600 --> 14:06.070
Hmm?

14:06.070 --> 14:07.900
Do you want to come over tomorrow?

14:08.130 --> 14:08.800
Huh?

14:10.130 --> 14:10.930
<i>Huh?!</i>

14:10.930 --> 14:13.640
It's okay, right? No school tomorrow.

14:13.640 --> 14:16.450
I want to ask you more about Tokyo and stuff!

14:16.450 --> 14:18.330
Uh, yeah, um...

14:18.330 --> 14:21.170
<i>Wh-Wh-Wha-What is this turning into?</i>

14:21.170 --> 14:22.150
What's wrong?

14:22.150 --> 14:25.550
Uh, nothing. It's just, uh, well...

14:25.800 --> 14:28.570
<i>I'm going to a girl's room already?</i>

14:29.610 --> 14:32.050
Don't you... want to come over?

14:32.050 --> 14:33.260
Yes, I do!

14:33.260 --> 14:34.870
Awesome!

14:34.870 --> 14:37.080
Hey, hey, let's exchange contact info, then.

14:43.190 --> 14:44.980
Okay, see you later!

14:44.980 --> 14:47.870
Y-Yeah. See you.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.850
<i>And here I am.</i>

14:56.730 --> 15:00.160
<i>Never in my life have I gone 
over to a girl's house.</i>

15:01.030 --> 15:04.040
<i>Also, this is still only 
my third day in Hokkaido!</i>

15:07.150 --> 15:11.840
<i>If my family finds out about this, 
I'm screwed. But still...</i>

15:12.700 --> 15:14.900
<i>The temptation was too strong!</i>

15:15.930 --> 15:18.370
<i>Hokkaido gals are a force 
to be reckoned with!</i>

15:18.370 --> 15:19.810
<i>Yes?</i>

15:19.810 --> 15:23.870
Um, my name is Shiki. Is Minami-san home?

15:23.870 --> 15:27.490
<i>Oh, Tsubasa? It's me. 
Door's open so come on in.</i>

15:27.490 --> 15:29.820
Uh, okay.

15:30.350 --> 15:32.590
<i>Their security is kind of weak.</i>

15:35.030 --> 15:36.620
Welcome!

15:36.620 --> 15:38.420
Th-Thank you.

15:38.420 --> 15:39.980
Come in, come in!

15:39.980 --> 15:42.120
Okay. Excuse me.

15:42.370 --> 15:45.050
<i>Why is she dressed so devilishly?!</i>

15:45.560 --> 15:47.370
Well aren't you lucky, Tsubasa.

15:48.700 --> 15:51.130
My parents aren't home today.

15:51.130 --> 15:53.010
<i>Huh?!</i>

15:53.010 --> 15:58.650
<i>I-Is this... Does that mean... 
No, no way. It can't be.</i>

15:58.650 --> 16:00.980
Tsubasa, over here.

16:03.490 --> 16:04.980
Well, come in!

16:08.270 --> 16:10.490
Wow! It's so warm.

16:10.490 --> 16:15.290
Right? The living room has floor 
heating and also a big heater.

16:15.290 --> 16:19.290
My room only has a small 
heater, so it's always cold.

16:19.290 --> 16:23.710
<i>Oh, I get it. That's why she said 
it's lucky her parents aren't here.</i>

16:26.130 --> 16:28.450
<i>Well that's a relief, at least.</i>

16:28.780 --> 16:32.000
<i>I don't think anything weird 
will happen in the living room.</i>

16:32.840 --> 16:33.640
Hyah?!

16:34.490 --> 16:35.670
That's hilarious!

16:35.670 --> 16:38.030
B-But your foot just touched me!

16:38.030 --> 16:40.140
"Hyah!" That's so cute!

16:41.050 --> 16:42.970
Well then, well then, Tsubasa.

16:44.330 --> 16:45.690
What are we gonna do?

16:45.690 --> 16:46.670
Huh?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.440
<i>Do?</i>

16:48.440 --> 16:51.030
Oh, right. I'll get you something to drink.

16:51.030 --> 16:52.490
Uh, thanks.

16:53.170 --> 16:55.500
What should I get you?

16:55.500 --> 16:58.040
Oh. Hey, Tsubasa. You okay with Katsugen?

16:58.040 --> 16:59.740
Sure. Whatever you have.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.410
So this is called Katsugen?

17:04.410 --> 17:05.140
Yeah.

17:04.410 --> 17:08.880
<b>Soft
Katsugen</b>

17:05.140 --> 17:08.880
I've loved Katsugen ever 
since I was a little squirt.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.720
Oh, really?

17:15.770 --> 17:16.840
Yum!

17:17.180 --> 17:21.010
<i>Huh, it tastes like one 
of those thick yogurt drinks.</i>

17:21.600 --> 17:23.160
Wh-What happened?

17:24.180 --> 17:28.270
There wasn't a lot left, so I 
thought I'd pour it all in,

17:28.270 --> 17:31.690
but I poured too fast and 
it splattered all over me.

17:32.690 --> 17:35.240
And it's really sticky. So gross!

17:35.240 --> 17:37.140
I'm gonna go change.

17:40.130 --> 17:44.730
<i>That was close! 
The shock almost pulverized my heart!</i>

17:45.530 --> 17:48.040
<i>Calm down. Calm down, me!</i>

17:51.400 --> 17:55.550
I didn't know what to pick, so I 
just gave up and grabbed this.

17:55.550 --> 17:57.590
<i>Advent of the demon king!</i>

17:57.590 --> 17:59.140
Uh... uh... uh...

17:59.140 --> 18:00.210
What's the matter?

18:00.210 --> 18:02.430
What are you wearing?

18:02.430 --> 18:03.230
Huh?

18:03.650 --> 18:07.560
It's warm inside, so this is 
how I usually dress at home.

18:08.960 --> 18:13.400
Uh, I brought this movie 
that I haven't watched yet.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.660
Oh, I haven't seen that one yet, either!

18:16.660 --> 18:18.110
Let's watch it!

18:18.470 --> 18:22.330
Flick this switch on, 
then slide this in here...

18:24.200 --> 18:26.200
Ready to go!

18:27.290 --> 18:28.970
Something wrong, Tsubasa?

18:29.370 --> 18:31.960
No, everything's okay.

18:33.290 --> 18:37.130
<i>You might've noticed, 
but I can be very persistent.</i>

18:37.130 --> 18:40.550
<i>Oh, boy. This is totally awkward.</i>

18:41.190 --> 18:45.110
<i>I'd fast forward, but it might 
look like I'm overthinking it.</i>

18:47.260 --> 18:48.060
<i>Huh?</i>

18:48.490 --> 18:51.170
<i>Wait a second. What is that voice?</i>

18:51.600 --> 18:54.600
<i>There's no way... Fuyuki-san?!</i>

18:54.600 --> 18:56.390
<i>You've got to be kidding me!</i>

18:56.390 --> 18:59.030
<i>Is she watching this and touching—</i>

18:59.260 --> 19:01.400
<i>J-Just hold on!</i>

19:01.400 --> 19:05.910
<i>This is bad, Fuyuki-san! If you touch 
me while making a voice like that...</i>

19:05.910 --> 19:07.120
Why not?

19:07.120 --> 19:09.870
Fuyuki-san, I-I...

19:09.870 --> 19:10.270
Huh?

19:12.070 --> 19:16.210
No more... I'm already full.

19:21.650 --> 19:24.660
<i>Isn't she being just a little too careless?</i>

19:24.660 --> 19:28.520
<i>I mean, who'd fall asleep dressed 
like that when a guy is over?</i>

19:30.180 --> 19:35.760
<i>Oh, I get it. She doesn't 
see me like that. As a guy.</i>

19:42.450 --> 19:43.920
Oh. You're awake.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.420
Huh? What about the movie?

19:46.420 --> 19:48.540
Sorry. It's already over.

19:50.060 --> 19:53.830
You were sleeping so peacefully, 
I didn't want to wake you up.

19:54.470 --> 19:58.500
I'll leave the Blu-ray here. 
You can return it whenever you want.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.660
Huh? Okay.

20:01.750 --> 20:03.710
Wait, what's this?

20:03.710 --> 20:08.240
The room is warm, but I still thought 
you'd catch cold sleeping like that.

20:13.430 --> 20:16.670
Anyway, it's getting dark, so I'd better go.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.050
Thanks for having me over.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.290
Tsubasa! Wait up!

20:34.880 --> 20:35.330
Huh?

20:39.690 --> 20:41.530
I'm sorry! I...

20:41.530 --> 20:43.780
I didn't realize I'd fallen asleep.

20:44.180 --> 20:47.850
This really sucks. 
I didn't mean for that to happen.

20:47.850 --> 20:49.820
So next time, maybe—

20:49.820 --> 20:53.480
How can you come outside dressed 
like that? You'll catch cold!

20:55.480 --> 20:56.930
Thank you.

20:57.470 --> 20:59.490
You want the jacket, too?

20:59.490 --> 21:01.320
No, I'm okay.

21:01.320 --> 21:04.470
I always dress like this 
when I run out for a second.

21:04.470 --> 21:08.250
Also, this is super warm.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.690
Is it? I'm glad.

21:18.670 --> 21:21.590
Hey, Tsubasa. I'm hungry.

21:21.590 --> 21:22.790
Let's go to Seicomart!

21:22.790 --> 21:24.280
Huh? Seicomart?

21:24.280 --> 21:27.560
Yeah! I'll even treat you as an apology.

21:27.560 --> 21:28.680
Hey, wait—

21:31.240 --> 21:32.180
Uh...

21:35.240 --> 21:52.180

Oh. Hey, hey. They make the 
rice balls here in the store.

23:30.870 --> 23:32.590
Huh? They even cook the rice?
