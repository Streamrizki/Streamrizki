WEBVTT

00:01.120 --> 00:02.390
Black Hole.

00:12.550 --> 00:16.000
<i>The day after I made a black 
hole appear over the academy,</i>

00:17.340 --> 00:21.660
<i>I was at the royal castle for 
an audience with the king.</i>

00:47.330 --> 00:50.910
<b>Villainess Level 99</b>

00:47.550 --> 00:50.910
I May Be the Hidden Boss but I'm Not the Demon Lord

01:53.360 --> 01:57.990
<b>The Hidden Boss Is Summoned to the Castle</b>

02:00.240 --> 02:01.770
Your Royal Majesty,

02:02.070 --> 02:04.090
Miss Yumiella Dolkness has arrived.

02:08.280 --> 02:09.440
Dolkness? That central wannabe.

02:08.710 --> 02:09.440
Black hair...

02:09.440 --> 02:12.480
Is it true that she's level 99?

02:12.480 --> 02:15.540
It seems she really did 
summon a black hole, though.

02:15.540 --> 02:16.970
How spooky...

02:24.700 --> 02:27.930
Yumiella Dolkness, raise your head.

02:33.060 --> 02:34.800
Miss Yumiella Dolkness.

02:35.270 --> 02:36.050
Yes.

02:36.430 --> 02:39.910
I'm aware of what happened at the academy.

02:40.390 --> 02:44.450
It seems my son and the teachers 
behaved quite ungraciously.

02:44.450 --> 02:45.810
I apologize.

02:46.210 --> 02:47.240
The king just...

02:47.240 --> 02:48.810
...bowed his head?!

02:49.070 --> 02:52.950
N-Not at all. I did something 
that was blatantly foolhardy

02:52.950 --> 02:55.320
and caused a great deal 
of trouble to everyone.

02:55.320 --> 02:58.950
No, denouncing you based 
on one-sided assumptions

02:58.950 --> 03:03.120
without first ascertaining your 
abilities was unreasonable.

03:03.790 --> 03:04.710
That said...

03:05.270 --> 03:08.470
It certainly is difficult to believe 
a dainty young lady such as yourself

03:08.470 --> 03:10.710
could be level 99.

03:10.980 --> 03:12.210
Which is why...

03:13.270 --> 03:18.500
I would like to have my knight captain, 
Adolf, judge your authenticity.

03:18.970 --> 03:22.460
There is no one who would 
not accept his decision.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.350
<i>Knight Captain Adolf.</i>

03:25.350 --> 03:27.650
<i>He's said to be the strongest 
knight in the kingdom.</i>

03:27.960 --> 03:30.270
<i>I think his level is around 60.</i>

03:31.110 --> 03:38.610
Adolf

03:31.110 --> 03:38.610
Come at me if you want to die!

03:31.410 --> 03:36.860
<i>Considering you had to be at level 60 or 
70 to fight the Demon Lord in the game,</i>

03:36.860 --> 03:38.610
<i>it's clear he's strong.</i>

03:38.610 --> 03:41.840
Out of respect to one who has reached 
the highest level man can attain,

03:41.840 --> 03:44.650
I will unleash an attack 
with all my strength.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.730
<i>Wait, right here and now?</i>

03:47.730 --> 03:49.880
<i>Would counterattacking 
be the right choice here?</i>

03:50.610 --> 03:54.380
<i>The king didn't say I should either 
fight him or evade his attack.</i>

03:54.930 --> 03:55.880
<i>So I'll...</i>

03:56.740 --> 03:58.130
<i>get out of it with a bow!</i>

04:04.200 --> 04:07.640
There aren't even any knights 
who can evade that attack.

04:07.860 --> 04:11.480
And she appeared calm enough to 
think about how she should react.

04:11.850 --> 04:14.650
I believe it is true that she is level 99.

04:16.960 --> 04:19.200
I apologize, Miss Yumiella.

04:19.810 --> 04:22.010
But I cannot defy His Majesty's orders.

04:24.130 --> 04:26.520
Brilliantly done, Miss Yumiella.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.910
Would you mind showing 
me your magic, as well?

04:29.160 --> 04:29.930
Of course.

04:30.950 --> 04:32.420
Please excuse me, then.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.090
Shadow Lance.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.500
Ah, dark magic? How unusual.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.280
What do you think, Head Palace Mage?

04:50.280 --> 04:54.940
There are some who say that 
evil monsters use dark magic.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.690
Allow me to answer your question.

04:58.060 --> 05:02.950
Dark magic, like the four main 
attributes and light magic,

05:03.270 --> 05:05.900
is no better or worse than
another magical attribute.

05:05.900 --> 05:10.670
Like light magic, it's extremely powerful,

05:10.670 --> 05:16.210
but its up to the user to decide how
it's used, just like any other attribute.

05:16.480 --> 05:20.390
Users of dark magic are quite rare.

05:20.390 --> 05:26.470
Perhaps this, along with their appearance, 
led people to imagine they were evil.

05:26.720 --> 05:31.980
Hmm... So people fear things that 
they do not know or understand.

05:32.370 --> 05:37.230
Perhaps black hair is abhorred 
for the same reason.

05:37.230 --> 05:41.700
<i>Oh... Is he saying all this for my sake?</i>

05:42.250 --> 05:43.990
<i>I should be very grateful.</i>

05:44.280 --> 05:49.780
Miss Yumiella, well done reaching heights 
that none in this world have reached before.

05:50.090 --> 05:53.500
Now, I would love to know just 
how you achieved such a level.

05:53.800 --> 05:57.130
Of course. I didn't do anything 
particularly special.

05:57.430 --> 06:00.990
After earning money by killing 
monsters in our domain,

06:00.990 --> 06:04.710
I acquired an Amulet of Growth, 
entered a dungeon alone,

06:04.710 --> 06:08.640
played a Monster-Calling Flute, 
and just kept killing monsters.

06:08.640 --> 06:11.080
Without an Amulet of Protection?

06:11.080 --> 06:12.600
A dungeon? Alone?!

06:12.600 --> 06:14.210
And she even used a Monster-Calling Flute?!

06:14.210 --> 06:15.270
Most people would die!

06:15.890 --> 06:19.150
Adolf, could you do the same thing?

06:19.780 --> 06:22.640
Only one amulet can be equipped at once.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.230
That's why I never remove 
my Amulet of Protection,

06:26.230 --> 06:28.200
which protects me from fatal wounds.

06:28.640 --> 06:33.080
I would be too terrified to call 
monsters to me if I were alone.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.960
<i>Wait, isn't this normal, though?</i>

06:37.810 --> 06:39.840
Yumiella Dolkness,

06:39.840 --> 06:43.470
I would like you to wield your 
strength as a sword for our kingdom.

06:45.590 --> 06:48.950
Of course. As one of Your 
Majesty's loyal subjects,

06:48.950 --> 06:52.220
I have every intention of serving as 
the Kingdom of Valschein's shield.

06:53.810 --> 06:55.370
Very well.

06:55.370 --> 06:58.480
Wield your strength for this 
kingdom when it is in peril.

06:59.270 --> 07:04.540
Now, I would like to reward your 
unprecedented accomplishment.

07:04.540 --> 07:07.450
If there is anything you desire, simply ask.

07:08.770 --> 07:13.240
Be it a peerage, a domain, or even 
a royal treasure, it is yours.

07:13.240 --> 07:16.000
I'm even willing to welcome 
you into the royal family.

07:16.380 --> 07:20.000
<i>Is he talking about letting me 
marry someone in the royal family?</i>

07:20.000 --> 07:22.500
<i>It's a very generous offer, but...</i>

07:22.960 --> 07:26.840
<i>He probably just wants to come up with 
a way to chain me to the kingdom.</i>

07:27.730 --> 07:31.820
<i>But what I want is absolute peace.</i>

07:33.050 --> 07:37.100
While I didn't expect such a 
kind offer, I am most grateful.

07:37.100 --> 07:39.170
So long as I and the 
kingdom may live in peace,

07:39.170 --> 07:41.120
with all the necessities for survival,

07:41.120 --> 07:43.030
there is nothing else I wish for.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.570
I see.

07:45.570 --> 07:49.240
Then I give you my word that I will do 
my utmost to grant you a life of peace.

07:49.830 --> 07:51.490
<i>I'm sorry, Your Majesty.</i>

07:51.490 --> 07:55.610
<i>I fully intend to flee the kingdom if 
anything happens that I don't like.</i>

07:57.000 --> 07:58.650
<i>After that, for some reason,</i>

07:58.960 --> 08:01.670
<i>I was invited to the queen's chambers.</i>

08:02.600 --> 08:04.010
Miss Yumiella.

08:05.090 --> 08:07.200
Thank you for coming.

08:07.200 --> 08:11.300
This is not a place of official business, 
so there's no need for formalities.

08:11.670 --> 08:15.370
All right. Thank you for inviting me here.

08:15.740 --> 08:19.310
Nothing said within this room will 
ever be known to those outside.

08:20.020 --> 08:23.270
I have discussions in here that I don't 
want others knowing about, after all.

08:23.580 --> 08:25.280
<i>I want to go home right now!</i>

08:26.450 --> 08:28.650
Please, don't be so wary.

08:28.870 --> 08:32.430
Both His Majesty and I 
are quite taken with you.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.410
Thank you very much.

08:34.720 --> 08:39.320
You seem to think having any kind 
of authority is troublesome.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.600
But you seem intelligent.

08:41.600 --> 08:45.150
If you were a woman of ambition...

08:45.460 --> 08:46.800
The thought gives me chills.

08:47.440 --> 08:51.440
Um, why do you trust me so much?

08:51.970 --> 08:53.430
There are many nobles who pretend to be

08:53.430 --> 08:56.360
free of avarice to get 
close to the royal family.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.430
Knowing the difference 
comes naturally to me now.

09:01.940 --> 09:04.710
Now, shall we cut to the chase?

09:04.710 --> 09:06.170
This is information

09:06.170 --> 09:09.700
that only the royal family and a 
precious few nobles are privy to.

09:10.690 --> 09:13.340
The Demon Lord will return in two years.

09:13.340 --> 09:17.580
Yumiella, I want you to assist 
us in defeating the Demon Lord.

09:19.100 --> 09:23.610
The Demon Lord? You mean the 
one spoken of in the legends?

09:23.610 --> 09:27.040
Yes. The first king, who 
defeated the Demon Lord,

09:27.040 --> 09:31.340
prophesied that the enemy would return, 
including when it would happen.

09:31.710 --> 09:35.350
<i>So the royal family knew the 
Demon Lord was coming back?</i>

09:35.600 --> 09:39.790
We are formulating a plan 
to defeat the Demon Lord

09:39.790 --> 09:42.610
with a small, elite force 
centered around Edwin.

09:42.610 --> 09:44.130
As the leaders of the people,

09:44.130 --> 09:46.860
the royal family has an obligation 
to defeat the Demon Lord.

09:47.350 --> 09:51.310
There are other talented students 
at the Royal Academy, as well.

09:51.310 --> 09:53.170
Provided they are nurtured well,

09:53.170 --> 09:56.740
it may be possible to assemble a force 
of students to take on the Demon Lord.

09:56.950 --> 10:00.600
<i>So they admitted Alicia, 
a user of light magic,</i>

10:00.600 --> 10:03.750
<i>in anticipation of having 
her fight the Demon Lord.</i>

10:03.750 --> 10:09.250
(What? Prince Edwin?!
What are you doing here?!)

10:04.410 --> 10:09.250
Come to think of it, Edwin was looking into 
the academy's scheme in the game, too.

10:09.750 --> 10:13.320
I understand. Of course, 
I would be happy to help.

10:13.660 --> 10:18.260
<i>I'd planned to take out the Demon Lord 
myself if it came to that, anyway.</i>

10:18.550 --> 10:20.800
Thank you, Miss Yumiella.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.100
However, I am sorry to say this,

10:24.100 --> 10:29.740
but having you defeat the Demon Lord would 
not be the best thing for this kingdom.

10:29.740 --> 10:33.780
You mean because it would bring the 
legitimacy of the royal family into question?

10:34.070 --> 10:36.280
Yes. As I said a moment ago,

10:36.280 --> 10:39.530
it must be the royal family 
that defeats the Demon Lord.

10:40.020 --> 10:44.540
Otherwise, our right to rule the 
kingdom would come under suspicion.

10:44.870 --> 10:46.960
Oh, I know, Miss Yumiella!

10:46.960 --> 10:49.920
Why don't you become
a saint and marry Edwin?

10:49.920 --> 10:51.170
No, thank you.

10:51.590 --> 10:53.920
<i>Oops! That was pure reflex!</i>

10:54.360 --> 10:56.520
I'm sorry... That was rude of me.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.190
It's quite all right.

10:59.190 --> 11:02.290
But we have two years before 
we must fight the Demon Lord.

11:02.290 --> 11:04.180
Please take your time, and think about it.

11:06.190 --> 11:08.090
The problem we face now

11:08.090 --> 11:12.540
is all the nobles trying to drag 
you into their own factions.

11:12.540 --> 11:14.190
Their factions?

11:14.470 --> 11:17.690
Yes. There are two factions in this kingdom,

11:17.690 --> 11:20.400
the king's faction and the anti-king faction.

11:20.400 --> 11:23.450
It may become the spark 
that ignites a war.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.630
The anti-king faction is also 
known as the extremist faction.

11:26.630 --> 11:30.070
It is composed of various 
nobles led by Duke Hillrose.

11:30.460 --> 11:33.980
They are all nobles who are dissatisfied 
with the current state of the kingdom,

11:33.980 --> 11:36.290
and they have proposed wars of conquest

11:36.290 --> 11:39.270
against other countries as a means 
of taking out their frustrations.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.160
And the "central wannabes,"

11:42.160 --> 11:44.670
regional nobles who spend all their time

11:44.670 --> 11:46.830
in the capital despite 
holding no position there,

11:46.830 --> 11:50.730
are almost all anti-king, in 
other words, extremists.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.980
The head of the Dolkness 
family is no exception.

11:54.460 --> 12:00.240
<i>Which means... my parents are probably 
at Duke Hillrose's beck and call.</i>

12:00.560 --> 12:06.350
What should I do if my parents order 
me to marry into the Hillrose family?

12:06.350 --> 12:11.250
I will send a royal order to the Dolkness 
household forbidding your relocation.

12:11.250 --> 12:14.760
But I believe three years 
is the most I can buy you.

12:15.140 --> 12:18.260
Thank you. That's more than enough.

12:18.600 --> 12:22.010
<i>I need to do something about my family 
relations by the time I graduate.</i>

12:22.240 --> 12:26.840
Try to avoid the anti-king faction 
and the Hillroses in particular.

12:26.840 --> 12:30.640
Also, other countries are as 
unlikely as our own to overlook

12:30.640 --> 12:34.260
the emergence of someone who's 
reached level 99, so do be careful.

12:34.260 --> 12:35.400
I understand.

12:35.650 --> 12:39.050
I will also send one of His 
Majesty's men to the academy.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.870
If you need anything, 
feel free to talk to him.

12:45.020 --> 12:46.650
Welcome home.

12:46.990 --> 12:47.580
Um...

12:48.050 --> 12:51.830
I heard you met with the king 
over your level 99 status?

12:52.200 --> 12:55.090
Yes, and I had tea with the queen.

12:55.620 --> 12:59.090
The master has sent photos of 
potential marriage partners for you.

12:59.090 --> 13:01.970
They're all reputable 
men of central nobility.

13:02.290 --> 13:05.080
That aside, could you put on some tea?

13:05.080 --> 13:06.970
This was a gift from the queen.

13:07.330 --> 13:10.120
I can't eat it all on my 
own. Would you join me?

13:10.120 --> 13:11.480
Th-These are...

13:11.780 --> 13:14.360
sweets from a first-class pâtisserie!

13:14.360 --> 13:16.700
I'll prepare tea right away!

13:20.720 --> 13:22.490
She's a brilliant girl.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.760
I can't believe she reached 
level 99 by the age of 15.

13:26.760 --> 13:30.370
I didn't even know there was a limit 
to how high one's level could be.

13:30.880 --> 13:35.130
The head mage seems to think it's only an 
assumption that hasn't been verified yet.

13:35.130 --> 13:39.880
But if Miss Yumiella's level won't go any 
higher, then there's no doubt about it.

13:40.150 --> 13:43.940
I believe she had no choice 
but to get stronger.

13:43.940 --> 13:46.320
She seems to be estranged from her parents,

13:46.320 --> 13:49.750
and I'm sure her black hair has 
caused her to be shunned by many.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.490
She was loved by no one and 
had no one to depend on,

13:53.490 --> 13:56.010
yet she holds no grudge against 
those who surround her.

13:56.010 --> 13:57.520
She truly is strong.

13:58.060 --> 14:01.250
I'm sure other nobles will be 
maneuvering to win her over.

14:01.570 --> 14:04.640
We'll need to get things in 
order for her at the academy.

14:04.640 --> 14:08.750
Yes. Miss Yumiella wishes 
for nothing but peace.

14:08.750 --> 14:10.770
Though it would be nice if 
she made friends her age

14:10.770 --> 14:13.970
and developed an attachment to the kingdom...

14:14.500 --> 14:15.370
Yes...

14:18.000 --> 14:20.300
<i>One week after I was summoned to the castle,</i>

14:20.300 --> 14:23.330
<i>the way people looked at 
me had changed drastically.</i>

14:24.400 --> 14:27.080
<i>Even the classmates who 
had kept me at a distance</i>

14:27.080 --> 14:29.810
<i>gradually began to talk to me more.</i>

14:30.100 --> 14:32.420
Good morning, Miss Yumiella.

14:32.420 --> 14:34.190
You're here early again, I see.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.210
Good morning.

14:36.650 --> 14:40.800
<i>Until now, they thought I was too 
dangerous to even try to talk to.</i>

14:41.320 --> 14:44.640
Have you received any more invitations 
from the king since then?

14:44.640 --> 14:48.660
I heard the queen gave 
you a gift. Is that true?

14:48.660 --> 14:50.060
Y-Yes.

14:51.180 --> 14:52.700
How amazing!

14:56.080 --> 14:59.350
<i>Things are still the same as 
always between me and Alicia.</i>

15:00.590 --> 15:02.460
<i>As for the prince and his friends...</i>

15:03.370 --> 15:04.530
I apologize.

15:05.050 --> 15:05.880
Let's go.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.070
<i>That sums it up.</i>

15:10.070 --> 15:13.100
<i>The royal couple probably 
gave him a good scolding.</i>

15:15.570 --> 15:17.900
<i>And the most significant change of all is...</i>

15:18.310 --> 15:22.860
<i>I'm suddenly being called upon 
by all manner of noble boys.</i>

15:22.860 --> 15:27.360
And thus, we will rule over all the 
surrounding nations as our colonies!

15:27.630 --> 15:30.820
All you need to do is destroy 
the enemy nations' armies.

15:30.820 --> 15:34.120
You can leave all the political 
stuff to me, your husband!

15:34.380 --> 15:36.870
<i>I'm getting hit on like this every day.</i>

15:36.870 --> 15:40.880
<i>Most of the people who align with the 
king's faction are easy to get along with.</i>

15:41.380 --> 15:43.530
<i>They're content with a bit of small talk.</i>

15:43.530 --> 15:46.380
<i>There's no formal political 
conversation with them.</i>

15:46.840 --> 15:49.880
<i>Those of the extremist anti-king 
faction, on the other hand,</i>

15:49.880 --> 15:52.390
<i>are aggressive in their 
efforts to win me over.</i>

15:52.630 --> 15:53.670
<i>Like this guy.</i>

15:53.670 --> 15:57.920
And ultimately, we will rule 
over this entire continent!

15:57.920 --> 15:59.440
Doesn't that sound fantastic?

15:59.640 --> 16:03.150
<i>He's the most intense of all the 
anti-king people who've approached me</i>

16:03.150 --> 16:04.690
<i>in the past week.</i>

16:05.010 --> 16:07.890
I think this is quite a good deal for you!

16:07.890 --> 16:11.140
You, a black-haired girl, 
would become my wife!

16:11.140 --> 16:13.950
And I'll buy you all the 
dresses and jewelry you want.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.660
I decline.

16:15.660 --> 16:18.750
I only like people who are stronger than me.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.410
<i>This is the surefire method for 
refusing marriage proposals</i>

16:22.410 --> 16:24.870
<i>that I've come up with in the past few days.</i>

16:25.330 --> 16:28.690
Physical strength isn't enough to 
keep one going in this day and age.

16:28.690 --> 16:30.810
What's important is how smart you are.

16:30.810 --> 16:33.460
And that is where I excel!

16:33.460 --> 16:34.890
<i>He didn't get the hint.</i>

16:35.160 --> 16:37.680
Then you'll make sure I don't 
have to do violent things

16:37.680 --> 16:42.150
like fighting armies and 
putting down rebellions?

16:42.150 --> 16:46.260
N-No! A girl whose only talent is fighting 
need not think about anything else!

16:46.260 --> 16:49.650
All you need to do is listen to 
those who are superior! Namely, me!

16:50.150 --> 16:54.490
You call yourself superior, but 
are you the top of our grade?

16:55.430 --> 16:58.710
One's superiority is not 
determined by test scores.

16:58.960 --> 17:02.880
You say you'll rule the continent. 
So who will manage its affairs?

17:03.200 --> 17:06.210
Me, of course! I'm confident 
in my ability to rule!

17:06.520 --> 17:08.940
If you intend to unify the entire continent,

17:08.940 --> 17:12.840
that means you'll bring this kingdom's 
royal family under your rule, yes?

17:13.520 --> 17:14.100
Eh?

17:14.100 --> 17:18.850
Meaning you'll be committing insurrection 
against the royal family of Valschein.

17:18.850 --> 17:20.600
N-No... I...

17:20.890 --> 17:24.980
In this kingdom, the punishment 
for insurrection is death.

17:26.720 --> 17:29.400
I'll pretend this conversation 
never happened.

17:29.400 --> 17:33.030
But someone else may have overheard us.

17:33.030 --> 17:36.510
You might want to avoid coming 
in contact with me again.

17:36.890 --> 17:41.240
Just being around me may 
invite unwanted suspicion.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.130
D-Don't you tell anyone about this!

17:45.550 --> 17:47.310
<i>I should head back to my room.</i>

17:47.310 --> 17:49.130
<i>Nothing good will come 
of me wandering around.</i>

17:51.780 --> 17:53.130
Miss Yumiella!

17:53.130 --> 17:55.470
Good timing. I was just looking for you.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.470
Miss Eleonora Hillrose...

17:58.850 --> 18:00.480
<i>It's finally happened.</i>

18:00.480 --> 18:17.490
Eleonora

18:00.480 --> 18:17.490
I would be willing to allow
you to join my group.

18:01.110 --> 18:03.910
<i>The lone daughter of the 
only duke in Valschein,</i>

18:03.910 --> 18:08.520
<i>and part of the anti-king faction, Eleonora.</i>

18:09.120 --> 18:10.910
<i>Though she's a new student,</i>

18:10.910 --> 18:14.260
<i>she already reigns supreme over 
all the girls in the academy.</i>

18:14.260 --> 18:17.490
<i>It's rumored that she orders 
them around like a tyrant.</i>

18:17.490 --> 18:26.000
Alicia

18:17.490 --> 18:26.000
(Miss Eleonora is surrounded
by her followers again, I see.)

18:17.830 --> 18:21.540
<i>In the game, Yumiella tries 
to earn Eleonora's acceptance</i>

18:21.540 --> 18:26.000
<i>by doing mean things to Alicia, and 
that's what causes her to turn evil.</i>

18:26.380 --> 18:28.350
<i>The queen did warn me about this.</i>

18:28.350 --> 18:31.010
<i>I was hoping to avoid getting 
involved with her...</i>

18:31.400 --> 18:33.100
I'm glad I found you.

18:33.100 --> 18:36.010
I was simply dying to talk to you.

18:36.550 --> 18:39.010
<i>She's the type I absolutely can't stand.</i>

18:39.260 --> 18:41.750
You're free right now, aren't you?

18:41.750 --> 18:43.270
Please come to my tea party!

18:43.700 --> 18:47.400
<i>If I turn her down flat, that itself 
will invite all kinds of trouble.</i>

18:47.870 --> 18:50.900
Yes, I am free. Too free, in fact.

18:53.280 --> 18:58.230
<i>I've never really had a social life, so 
I know nothing about fashion or trends.</i>

18:58.230 --> 18:59.910
<i>Can I even manage girl talk?</i>

19:00.260 --> 19:01.540
<i>I cannot!</i>

19:01.750 --> 19:04.850
<i>But even I'm capable of some idle chatter.</i>

19:04.850 --> 19:07.500
<i>Behold! The three sacred 
implements of idle chatter!</i>

19:07.970 --> 19:09.200
Miss Yumiella.

19:09.200 --> 19:09.960
<i>Here it comes!</i>

19:10.370 --> 19:14.170
Parfeu is the only perfume for me.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.550
I see.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.550
I see.

19:16.760 --> 19:19.550
I was deeply moved by the 
ideology of the brand's founder.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.350
That's amazing.

19:20.300 --> 19:21.350
That's amazing.

19:21.350 --> 19:26.940
The story of the first time he ever 
made perfume is just so romantic.

19:27.030 --> 19:31.040
Please tell me more.

19:27.610 --> 19:29.760
Please tell me more.

19:30.320 --> 19:33.190
<i>By the way, I'm not listening to
 a word she's saying.</i>

19:33.920 --> 19:36.950
<i>In the game, she was always busy 
being the queen of the academy,</i>

19:36.950 --> 19:38.960
<i>so she didn't show up all that often.</i>

19:38.960 --> 19:40.580
<i>I didn't expect her to be such a chatterbox.</i>

19:40.880 --> 19:44.340
<i>She looks way more like 
a villainess than I do.</i>

19:44.340 --> 19:47.080
<i>I really want to raise a big 
stink about this casting error.</i>

19:47.470 --> 19:52.300
<i>But did she invite me here just to 
talk to me about stuff like this?</i>

19:54.510 --> 19:56.090
<i>Finally getting to the point now?</i>

19:56.500 --> 19:58.280
Miss Yumiella Dolkness...

19:58.990 --> 20:01.470
I want you to give up on Prince Edwin!

20:01.790 --> 20:02.610
Huh?

20:03.580 --> 20:05.910
On Prince Edwin?

20:05.910 --> 20:10.880
Yes. If you'll do that, I'm willing 
to allow you to join my group.

20:11.300 --> 20:13.860
Um...

20:13.860 --> 20:15.660
Don't play dumb with me!

20:15.660 --> 20:20.040
I know the king suggested 
that you marry Prince Edwin!

20:20.040 --> 20:22.760
You are not fit to be Prince Edwin's wife!

20:22.760 --> 20:24.740
If you don't want to make an enemy of me,

20:24.740 --> 20:26.620
give up and stay away from him!

20:27.570 --> 20:30.020
<i>Am I the one you should be saying that to?</i>

20:30.020 --> 20:32.630
<i>Not Alicia, the one he's with all the time?</i>

20:33.170 --> 20:37.110
I informed His Majesty that I had 
no desire to wed Prince Edwin.

20:37.110 --> 20:37.970
You're lying!

20:37.970 --> 20:39.700
You met the queen after that

20:39.700 --> 20:42.640
and told her you wanted to marry 
Prince Edwin, didn't you?!

20:42.620 --> 20:43.860
No, I did not.

20:43.860 --> 20:47.520
The fact that there's been no announcement 
after a whole week proves it.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.760
You do have a point.

20:50.760 --> 20:54.130
You seem to be aware of 
your place. That's good.

20:54.570 --> 20:57.120
If you'll swear to stay 
away from Prince Edwin,

20:57.120 --> 21:00.240
I'll allow you to be my friend.

21:00.240 --> 21:03.990
I appreciate the invitation,
but I must turn it down, as well.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.000
What?! Why—

21:06.790 --> 21:09.180
Don't tell me you're only 
pretending to be disinterested,

21:09.180 --> 21:11.620
but you really are after Prince Edwin!

21:12.260 --> 21:13.250
<i>God, she's a pain.</i>

21:14.070 --> 21:18.640
There is someone far more worthy 
of Prince Edwin than I am.

21:18.640 --> 21:19.470
Huh?

21:19.840 --> 21:21.980
That would be you.

21:21.980 --> 21:24.720
I believe you and His Highness 
would make a fine couple.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.140
Oh, my!

21:26.510 --> 21:28.600
You have a very good eye!

21:28.600 --> 21:32.320
I've danced with Prince 
Edwin many times, you know!

21:32.320 --> 21:37.640
Prince Edwin is so wonderful when 
he dances! He's such a gentleman!

21:36.490 --> 21:37.640
<i>She's so easy.</i>

21:37.640 --> 21:40.820
<i>So the reason she approached 
me was actually the prince?</i>

21:47.050 --> 21:49.450
Excuse me, Miss Yumiella.

21:49.450 --> 21:51.830
Would you mind if we sat with you?

21:52.210 --> 21:53.580
Oh... Please.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.130
May I sit here?

21:55.700 --> 21:56.690
Of course.

22:01.090 --> 22:02.350
Miss Yumiella...

22:02.720 --> 22:04.470
Are you the Demon Lord?

22:05.310 --> 22:06.060
Huh?
